# MAGIC ## Advanced Machine Learning Operations
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this course, you will be provided with a comprehensive understanding of the machine learning lifecycle and MLOps, emphasizing best practices for data and model management, testing, and scalable architectures. It covers key MLOps components, including CI/CD, pipeline management, and environment separation, while showcasing Databricks’ tools for automation and infrastructure management, such as Databricks Asset Bundles (DABs), Workflows, and Mosaic AI Model Serving. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You will learn about monitoring, custom metrics, drift detection, model rollout strategies, A/B testing, and the principles of reliable MLOps systems, providing a holistic view of implementing and managing ML projects in Databricks.
