# MAGIC # Demonstration - Integration Tests with Databricks Workflows
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This demonstration guides users through creating a Model Training Pipeline Workflow in Databricks using three notebooks: **01 Silver to Feature Store for preparing features**, **02 Feature Validation for validating features**, and **03 Train Model on Features for training a model**. The workflow begins by setting up a Databricks job with the first notebook, adding necessary parameters, and ensuring successful execution. Dependent tasks are then added sequentially for the remaining notebooks, with each task configured to use appropriate parameters and run on the specified cluster. This process demonstrates how to build an end-to-end pipeline in Databricks Workflows, integrating data preparation, validation, and model training in a scalable and structured manner.
# MAGIC

# MAGIC
# MAGIC These notebooks will be used to create a workflow in Databricks.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Steps to Create the Workflow
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Navigate to Workflows**:
# MAGIC    - Click on **Workflows** in the Databricks UI.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. **Create a New Job**:
# MAGIC    - Click on **Create Job**.
# MAGIC    - Set the Job name to ***Integration Tests with Databricks Workflows*** or something similar for easy identification.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. **Set Up the First Task**:
# MAGIC    - Provide a **Task Name** (e.g., `Silver to Feature Store`).
# MAGIC    - Set the **Type** to `Notebook`.
# MAGIC    - For the **Source**, select `Workspace`.
# MAGIC    - In **Path**, navigate to the first notebook: `01 Silver to Feature Store`.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 4. **Configure Compute**:
# MAGIC    - In the **Compute** section, select the cluster you have been working on.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 5. **Add Parameters**:
# MAGIC    - In the **Parameters** section, add the required parameters for the notebook using the keys and values given here (key: value):
# MAGIC      - **catalog: dbacademy**
# MAGIC      - **column: Age**
# MAGIC      - **schema: <your schema>**
# MAGIC      - **silver_table_name: diabetes**
# MAGIC      - **target_column: Diabetes_binary**
# MAGIC    Alternatively, you can click on JSON next to the the parameter entries and copy and paste the following:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC    ```
# MAGIC       {
# MAGIC          "catalog": "dbacademy",
# MAGIC          "target_column": "Diabetes_binary",
# MAGIC          "schema": "<your_schema>",

# MAGIC ### Step 3: Verify Model Registration in Unity Catalog
# MAGIC After completing Step 2, the final step is to confirm that the trained model has been successfully **logged in Unity Catalog**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **1. Check the Model Naming Convention**
# MAGIC - The model will be named following this pattern:
# MAGIC   ```
# MAGIC   dbacademy.<schema_name>.workflows_classifier_model
# MAGIC   ```
# MAGIC   - Replace `<schema_name>` with the **schema name you used in Step 2**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **2. Locate the Model in Unity Catalog**
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to **Unity Catalog** in the Databricks UI.
# MAGIC 2. Open the **schema** you have been working on.
# MAGIC 3. Look for the model named **`workflows_classifier_model`**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **3. Verify Model Lineage (Optional)**
# MAGIC - You can inspect the model lineage within **Catalog Explorer**:
# MAGIC   1. Click on the **model version**.
# MAGIC   2. Select **Lineage**.
# MAGIC   3. Choose **Workflows** to see that this model was created using the workflow you just ran.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC By confirming the model's presence in Unity Catalog, you ensure that the **end-to-end workflow has successfully stored and registered the model for future use**.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Additionally, you can inspect the model lineage within **Catalog Explorer** by clicking on the model version and selecting lineage. Select **Workflows** to see that this model was created using the job you created.

# MAGIC ## Concluding Remarks
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demonstration, we explored how to perform an **integration test** using **Databricks Workflows**. The process involved the following steps:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Creating a Simple Job**:
# MAGIC    - We started by creating a workflow that read silver-layered data from **Unity Catalog**, transformed it, and created a **feature table** stored in the **Databricks Feature Store**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. **Validating Features**:
# MAGIC    - We attached a second notebook to the workflow to validate that the features in the feature table were behaving as expected, such as confirming normalization.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. **Training a Model**:
# MAGIC    - A third notebook was added to train a model using the validated features, and the resulting model was stored in **Unity Catalog** for centralized management.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC By completing this workflow, we demonstrated how to build and validate an end-to-end pipeline for machine learning using Databricks Workflows, ensuring both the data and model meet expectations at every step.
