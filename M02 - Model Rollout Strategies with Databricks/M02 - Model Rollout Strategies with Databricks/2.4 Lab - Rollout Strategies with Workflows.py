# MAGIC # Lab: Rollout Strategies with Workflows
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this lab, you will do the following:
# MAGIC 1. Bring in a table from Databricks Marketplace.
# MAGIC 1. Perform feature engineering and store the table in Databricks Feature Store.
# MAGIC 1. Perform validation test to check for missing values, confirm the schema, and check for non-negative values. 
# MAGIC 1. You will also check that normalization was carried out correctly. 
# MAGIC 1. Finally, you will train and serve 2 models while directing traffic to one model 40% of the time and to the other model 60% of the time. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Learning Objectives**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC By the end of this lab you will be able to
# MAGIC - Demonstrate knowledge of how to setup integration tests with Databricks Workflows.
# MAGIC - Demonstrate knowledge of how to configure a model serving endpoint for serving an uneven traffic distribution for 2 models. 
# MAGIC - Demonstrate an understanding of working with MLflow and Unity Catalog for testing rollout strategies.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC * To run this notebook, you need to use one of the following Databricks runtime(s): **16.3.x-cpu-ml-scala2.12**
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## REQUIRED - SELECT CLASSIC COMPUTE
# MAGIC Before executing cells in this notebook, please select your classic compute cluster in the lab. Be aware that **Serverless** is enabled by default.
# MAGIC Follow these steps to select the classic compute cluster:
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to the top-right of this notebook and click the drop-down menu to select your cluster. By default, the notebook will use **Serverless**.
# MAGIC 1. If your cluster is available, select it and continue to the next cell. If the cluster is not shown:
# MAGIC   - In the drop-down, select **More**.
# MAGIC   - In the **Attach to an existing compute resource** pop-up, select the first drop-down. You will see a unique cluster name in that drop-down. Please select that cluster.
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC **NOTE:** If your cluster has terminated, you might need to restart it in order to select it. To do this:
# MAGIC 1. Right-click on **Compute** in the left navigation pane and select *Open in new tab*.
# MAGIC 1. Find the triangle icon to the right of your compute cluster name and click it.
# MAGIC 1. Wait a few minutes for the cluster to start.
# MAGIC 1. Once the cluster is running, complete the steps above to select your cluster.

# MAGIC ## Conclusion
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this lab, you created a workflow that demonstrates common testing strategies with a goal of training 2 models and serving them with Mosaic AI Model Serving. You learned how integral test strategies are the role MLflow and Unity Catalog play in accomplishing tasks involving testing. Finally, you demonstrated knowledge of splitting traffic in a 40/60 -split by configuring deployments with Mosaic AI Model Serving.
