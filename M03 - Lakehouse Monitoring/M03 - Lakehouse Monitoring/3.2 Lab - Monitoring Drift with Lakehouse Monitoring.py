# MAGIC ## Initiate Inference Monitoring
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Here you will use Python to initiate the monitoring of your inference table using Lakehouse Monitoring. This will generate two table: profile metrics and drift metrics. In addition, a Databricks Dashboard will also be generated. We will inspect all these assets later. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Terminology: 
# MAGIC - Your **primary table** is your inference table you created by running the classroom setup. The name of this table is `model_logs`.
# MAGIC - Your **baseline table** is your source of truth for your data. The name of this table is `baseline_features`

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ## Locate the Monitoring Dashboard
# MAGIC
# MAGIC There are two methods for locating the monitoring Dashboard.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to the underlying inference table `model_logs` and click on **Quality** and click on **View Dashboard**
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to the underlying inference table `model_logs` and click on **Lineage** and click on **Open in a dashboard** and find the dashboard you just created.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Inspect Monitoring Dashboard
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. After navigating to the canvas, scroll down until you see **Numerical Feature Drift**.
# MAGIC 1. Click on the kebab on the widget with title **# Features with Numerical Drift**.
# MAGIC 1. Click on **View Dataset**. This will take you to the generated **SQL code**. Modify it to not limit to the latest window by commenting out a single line.
# MAGIC 1. Copy and paste your answer in the next cell.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Do not run the SQL code** -  you will receive an error since you are working in a notebook. However, you can run the modified code in the Data tab of your dashboard.

# COMMAND ----------


# Copy and paste the code you modified above. 
<FILL_IN>

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC > **⚠️ Note:**  
# MAGIC > You may encounter a `CAST_INVALID_INPUT` error in the **Numerical Feature Quantile Drift** widget.  
# MAGIC > This occurs because the auto-generated query attempts to cast the string `"Baseline"` to a `TIMESTAMP` type in the `Window` column.  
# MAGIC > While this error does not affect other metrics or drift detection functionality, you can optionally resolve it using the steps below.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Steps to Diagnose and Fix the Error (Optional)**
# MAGIC - **Step 1:**  
# MAGIC   Navigate to the **Numerical Feature Quantile Drift** widget in the monitoring dashboard.  
# MAGIC   If there's a rendering failure, you will see a `CAST_INVALID_INPUT` error message displayed within the widget.
# MAGIC - **Step 2:**  
# MAGIC   Click the **kebab menu (⋮)** in the top-right corner of the widget and select **View Dataset**.  
# MAGIC   This opens the SQL query that powers the visual.
# MAGIC - **Step 3:**  
# MAGIC   In the dataset editor, scroll down and click **Diagnose error**.  
# MAGIC   The Databricks Assistant will analyze the issue and provide a suggested fix.
# MAGIC - **Step 4:**  
# MAGIC   Click **Replace active cell content** to apply the Assistant’s suggested query.  
# MAGIC   The corrected query will ensure the `Window` column in the baseline portion uses a proper timestamp type, typically by replacing `"Baseline"` with `CAST(NULL AS TIMESTAMP)`.
# MAGIC - **Step 5:**  
# MAGIC   Click **Run** to execute the updated query.
# MAGIC - **Step 6:**  
# MAGIC   Once the query runs successfully, the widget should render correctly, and the error message will disappear.
# MAGIC This fix helps ensure type consistency in the `UNION` clause across datasets, resolving the rendering error in the visual.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Create a New Widget in the Canvas
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Next, create a new widget that provides a visual counter for the precision macro during the last window. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Steps: 
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to the canvas you just created. 
# MAGIC 1. Copy or create a new visualization using the **Add a visualization** blue button at the bottom of the Canvas screen. 
# MAGIC 1. Set the Dataset value to **performance_last_window**. 
# MAGIC 1. Set the **Visualization** to **Counter**.
# MAGIC 1. Set the **Value** to **precision_macro**. 
# MAGIC 1. Set the **Target** to **Window**.
# MAGIC 1. Give it a title **Precision Macro** as the **Title** and **In the last time window** for the **Description**.

# MAGIC ## Lineage and Alerts for Drift Detection
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The following instructions are not meant to send you an alert to any device. It is only to demonstrate how to use lineage alongside alerts for your metric tables.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Navigate to Queries**:
# MAGIC    - On the left-hand sidebar of the Databricks workspace, click on **Queries**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Create a Query**:
# MAGIC    - Click on **Create Query** in the top-right corner.
# MAGIC    - Write a query to calculate the average value of the **Count** column in your profile metrics table:
# MAGIC      
# MAGIC       ```SELECT AVG(Count) AS avg_count FROM model_logs_profile_metrics;```
# MAGIC
# MAGIC    - Give the Query a name like `Drift Alert 1`
# MAGIC    - Once the query is complete, click **Save** to save it.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Create an Alert**:
# MAGIC    - Navigate to **Alerts** on the left-hand sidebar and click **Create Alert**.
# MAGIC    - Provide the alert with a **name** like `Test alert`.
# MAGIC    - In the right-hand SQL editor panel, paste the query you have saved before.
# MAGIC > ****Note: Before running the query, make sure to set the current catalog and schema, and follow the `catalog.schema.table_name` structure.****
# MAGIC    - Click the **Run** button to validate the query.
# MAGIC    - Define a **Trigger Condition**:
# MAGIC      - Example: Trigger the alert when the value is above 20.
# MAGIC    - Click **Test condition**.
# MAGIC      - If the result satisfies the condition, you’ll see:`Triggered: Alert will trigger based on current data.`
# MAGIC    - Set the **Schedule**.
# MAGIC    - Under **Notify**, search and add users or destinations. 
# MAGIC    - Finally, click **Create** and select the folder to save it.
# MAGIC 1. **Monitor Lineage and Updates**:
# MAGIC    - Go back to the **Catalog** on the left sidebar.
# MAGIC    - Navigate to your **model_logs_profile_metrics** table.
# MAGIC    - Click on **Lineage** and then **Queries** to see the queries associated with this table.
# MAGIC       - You will see the `Drift Alert 1` listed there.
# MAGIC    - Whenever there’s an update or drift detected in your model or dataset, the alert will notify you automatically. You can then go to the table's **Lineage** tab to investigate the issue.
